Thanks a lot for submitting to <%= @event.name %>. We received lots of amazing talk submissions, and that's allowed us to put together a diverse and high quality program.

Unfortunately we've also had to turn down a lot of excellent proposals. I'm sorry to say that we were not able to accept your submission titled, <%= @proposal.title %>, this year. This is always the toughest part knowing that we simply can't fit all the good talks in.

Hopefully we can still welcome you as an attendee coming summer. Meanwhile we encourage you to also submit your proposal to ClojuTRE (https://clojutre.org/2019/), which is one of our own favorite conferences.

Thanks again for your submission, we really appreciate your willingness to share with the community.

The <%= @event.name %> Program Committee
